<h3>About the Project</h3>

<p>This was homework for our Pandas unit.  We looked at video game sales to identify any trends that might be of interest.

<p>Most of our findings were not surprising, but confirmed what we had assumed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a significant majority of the purchasers are men (84%)</li>
  <li>a majority of the purchasers (63%) are between 20-24</li>
  <li>Final Critic accounts for the most revenue (higher price and more purchases)</li>
  <li>but none of the games on their own account for a significant percentage of the revenue</li>
</ul>
